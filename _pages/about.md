## What is RROx and what we do

Reproducible Research Oxford (RROx) is the grassroots community node of the UK Reproducible Network (UKRN) at the University of Oxford. We are a University-wide initiative focused on spreading the culture of reproducibility across Oxford.

RROx engages and supports the community by developing and encouraging the growth of reproducible research and enabling researchers and students to conduct work that is rigorous and open by providing training and resources. The RROx mailing list has members from all the academic divisions of the University of Oxford. Group members, as well as the UKRN Institutional Lead and Local Network Leads, span all career stages from DPhil student to senior professor. They also include representation from the Bodleian Libraries and Research Services.

To join the mailing list send a message to [rroxford-subscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk](mailto:rroxford-subscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk).
