summary: Panel discussions on how AI can use public research data, the benefits and risks for open science, and what current regulations allow.
---

What can happen to your research data once you have shared it with the public? Can artificial intelligence (AI) tools be trained on public or shared datasets? What do European and UK regulations say? What are the benefits and the risks that AI poses to open and reproducible science?

**Dungeons and Data** brought together representatives from academia, technology, and the law to explore these questions through real-life examples. The afternoon featured:

- Talks from legal and technical experts on AI regulation and responsible innovation  
- Discussions about the safeguards needed when sharing sensitive data  
- Examples of how AI can strengthen, or undermine, open and reproducible science  
- A chance to quiz practitioners who straddle law, policy, and research infrastructures

The event was hosted at the Weston Library Lecture Theatre and was open to everyone interested in how data governance evolves alongside AI.
