summary: Weekly 5K run or walk where we discuss the realities of research reproducibility in a relaxed setting.
---

This group exists because many of us are trying to balance busy research lives with the need to stay active. Finding time for both exercise and academic discussion isn’t always easy, so we’ve brought them together. The idea is simple: we run or walk, and we talk.

Our conversations focus on research reproducibility — a topic that continues to raise important questions across disciplines, especially in this new era of AI and machine learning. Each week we share question prompts in pairs to guide the discussion, covering the challenges of replicating studies, the pressures of publishing, and how we can be more transparent in our own work. The pace is relaxed enough to allow conversation, whether you’re walking or running.

You don’t need to be a fast runner or an expert in reproducibility. This is a space for people who want to think out loud, listen to others, or just take a break from the screen in good company.
