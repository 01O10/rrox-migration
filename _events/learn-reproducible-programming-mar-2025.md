summary: A refreshed Software Carpentries workshop on the command line, Git, and Python essentials for reproducible analysis.
---

Building on the popularity of our 2024 workshop, this two-day Software Carpentries course returned in Hilary Term 2025. Participants spent concentrated time on:

- Command Line Interface fundamentals (half day)  
- Version control with Git (three-quarter day)  
- An introduction to Python focused on reproducible data workflows (three-quarter day)

The course is ideal for researchers who want to embed reproducibility from the start of a project or who need to retrofit better practices into ongoing work. As with all Carpentries offerings, teaching emphasised pair programming, friendly helper support, and “learning opportunities” over mistakes.

Places were free for University of Oxford students and staff, with priority for those ready to apply the skills immediately in their research groups.
