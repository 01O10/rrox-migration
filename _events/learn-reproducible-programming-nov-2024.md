summary: A two-day Software Carpentries workshop covering the Unix shell, Git for version control, and an introduction to Python.
---

We ran a free, in-person Software Carpentries workshop for researchers who wanted to strengthen their computational reproducibility toolkit. Over two packed days participants learned:

- The basics of the Unix shell and command-line workflows  
- How to track versions of work using Git and GitHub  
- An introduction to programming in Python focused on data analysis

The sessions were led by trained Carpentries instructors and helpers who guided learners through hands-on exercises and troubleshooting. Participants came from across the University — from Life Sciences and Medicine to Social Sciences, Engineering, and Education — making it a great place to swap experiences about reproducible practices.

The workshop also served as a gateway into the wider Carpentries instructor and helper community at Oxford. All students and staff were eligible to apply, and fees were covered by RROx and partners committed to making these skills part of everyday research practice.
