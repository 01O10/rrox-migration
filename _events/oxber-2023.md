summary: The sixth Oxford | Berlin Autumn School explored how open, transparent, and reproducible methods strengthen research culture.
---

The sixth Oxford | Berlin Autumn School on Open and Responsible Research focused on the interface between open research practices and research culture, as well as leadership in open research. Transparency and reproducibility of methods and results remain important hallmarks of high-quality research across all disciplines, yet these skills are often missing from traditional training routes. To close this gap the autumn school brought together advanced doctoral candidates and new postdocs for a five-day programme devoted to open, transparent, and reproducible workflows embedded in research ethics and meta-research.

### Programme highlights

- Biases in research and how to design more reliable studies  
- Ideas behind and tools for creating reproducible research pipelines  
- Meta-research and responsible research practices  
- Leadership and advocacy for open research  
- Hands-on workshops on R, Python, reproducible workflows, version control, data management, and preregistration

The programme combined lectures with interactive workshops so participants could tailor sessions to their projects. The autumn school was organised by the University of Oxford in collaboration with the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité (BIH) QUEST Centre for Responsible Research and Oxford Brookes University, with support from the Research England Enhancing Research Culture Fund, the BIH QUEST Centre, and Oxford Brookes.
