---

Transparency and reproducibility of research methods and results are important hallmarks of high quality across all disciplines. The 2024 Oxford | Berlin Summer School helped early-career researchers build the knowledge and skills needed to adopt open practices that extend well beyond traditional journal articles.

### Programme

The summer school combined lectures with interactive workshops to cover:

- Good research practice and research ethics  
- Reproducible workflows, from version control to literate programming  
- Responsible research and meta-research perspectives  
- Leadership and advocacy for open research practices

Participants could tailor their learning path and revisit previous programmes via the [QUEST event archive](https://www.bihealth.org/de/translation/innovationstreiber/quest-center/events/oxford-berlin-summer-school).
