Kate Bancroft joined the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing in 2024 as a Research Fellow. Before arriving in Oxford she worked within the Faculty of Social Sciences and Public Policy at King’s College London, where she was Deputy Director of the PhD Applied Public Policy programme. Her research interests sit at the intersection of health, sport, and physical activity with a focus on sex and gender. At Oxford Kate contributes to the EPIC Networks project, funded by the Helen Hamlyn Trust, which is testing how to build sustainable community connections that support healthy ageing across Oxfordshire.
