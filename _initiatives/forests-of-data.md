Our Reproducible Research Oxford (RROx) event in Wytham Woods — *Forests of Data: Realising the Benefits of Being Open and Reproducible in Research* — brings students, experienced researchers, publishers, and data-sharing experts together to swap stories about making data reusable.

The setting sparks honest conversations about:

- Overcoming resistance from teams or departments that are hesitant to share  
- Unlocking historic datasets hidden away in archives or lab notebooks  
- How to describe data so that others understand it years later  
- What responsible reuse looks like in practice

Participants spend the day with speakers, a woodland tour, and plenty of time for peer-to-peer questions. It is open to anyone looking for practical, friendly advice on sharing data in all disciplines.
