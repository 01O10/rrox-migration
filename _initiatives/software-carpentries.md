Since 2024 RROx has been working with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) to offer software training to researchers in Oxford, as well as tutor-training opportunities so we can keep building capacity locally. Workshops blend the command line, Git, and Python essentials, and every session is taught by trained Carpentries instructors and helpers.

Highlights from our Autumn 2025 workshop on “Python Essentials with Git for Data Analysis” include:

- A cross-disciplinary cohort drawn from Life Sciences, Medicine, Psychology, Social Sciences, Engineering, Education, and Mathematics  
- Hands-on exercises, paired programming, and helper support to tackle “learning opportunities” together  
- A brilliant venue at the Weston Library in the heart of Oxford

We are planning new courses and events around reproducibility — keep an eye on the [Events page]({{ '/events/' | relative_url }}) for the next dates, and check the [global Carpentries calendar](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-carpentries-19915407446) for workshops at other universities.

Follow our socials, join the mailing list, or talk to the Research Practice team if you would like to become an instructor or helper.
