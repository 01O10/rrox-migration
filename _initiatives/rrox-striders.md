RROx Striders came about because many of us are trying to balance the need to stay active with a desire to talk through real-world reproducibility challenges. Each Wednesday we meet outside the University Club, warm up, and then run or walk 5 km around University Parks while discussing prompts about open research.

- **When:** Wednesdays, 17:00 meet for a 17:15 start  
- **Where:** University Club, 11 Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3SZ  
- **Led by:** Kate Bancroft (Local Network Lead and former PE teacher)  
- **Who:** Anyone who enjoys thinking out loud and making reproducibility practical

Bring comfy shoes, your latest reproducibility puzzle, and a willingness to support others.
